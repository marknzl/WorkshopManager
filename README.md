## Overview
This is a web-based workshop manager which I developed independently in year 13 for my final computer studies assignment. It allows students to create accounts and view/enrol in workshops. Teachers can create workshops and are able to customize settings such as max students, date/time and more. File uploads are also supported, as well as the ability to create private workshops and allow students to join using invite-only codes.

## Tech stack
The backend is written entirely in Python which utilizes the Flask micro-web framework. The data store is just a simple MySQL database. The frontend is written in HTML/CSS and uses JS along with jQuery for a more interactive experience.
